Heart Dialogue
==============

Heart dialogue is a sensitive object that follows the heart beat of the person who places its finger on it. The piece aims to bring closer the heart beating to the user. Our heart is beating 24 hours a day and is what make us alive. The piece is a way to materialize and bring to life this simple but indispensable life pulse.

The piece was done by modeling an abstraction of a human heart, laser cutting it, electronics including pulse sensor, El Escudo Dos Shield, Arduino and EL WIRE red color.

Project supported and developed during Interactivos Birmingham Seminar. Responsive and immersive future technologies at MAC, Birmingham, UK.
